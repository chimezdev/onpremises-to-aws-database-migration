- States of this Demo
    - STAGE 1: Provision the environment using CloudFormation via a One-click deployment.
    - STAGE 2: Establish Private Connectiviy between the environments via VPC Peering
    - STAGE 3: Create and Configure the AWS side of the infrastructure
    - STAGE 4: Migrate Database and Cutover
    - STAGE 5: Account cleanup

## STAGE 1
- Login to the AWS Console as user with admin permission and make sure to be on `us-east-1 ` region.
[Click](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-dms-database-migration/DMS.yaml&stackName=DMS) to provision the base infrastructure.
- Take note of the values of the following ***parameters***
    - DBName
    - DBPassword
    - DBRootPassword
    - DBUser
- Scroll to the bottom, check the capabilities box and click ***Create Stack***
- Wait for the stack to be ***CREATE_COMPLETE*** state
- Navigate to the *EC2* console click on *Running Instaces*, the two instances *CatWEB* and *CatDB* will be running.
- Select the *CatWEB*, copy and open in a new tab the ***Public IPv4 DNS***.
- This will load the web application running on the on-premises environment.

## STAGE 2A - Create a VPC peering connection between the On-premises and AWS Environments
In production, a Direct Connect or a VPN would be used but here you are going to simulate it using VPC Peering to configure the connection between the two environments.
- Navigate to the AWS VPC console and click on ***Your VPCs***
- In addition to the default vpc, you will see the ***awsVPC*** and ***onpremVPC*** running in **IPv4 CIDR** ranges ***10.16.0.0/16*** and ***192.168.10.0/24*** respectively.
![Created VPCs](https://github.com/chimezdev/onpremises-to-aws-database-migration/blob/main/Images/Your_VPCs.png)
- Creating Peering Connections
    - On the left menu, scroll down and click on ***Peering connections*** then click on ***Create peering connection***
    - enter *A4L-ON-PREMISES-TO-AWS* as name tag
    - choose *onpremVPC* as *VPC(Requester)* and *awsVPC* as *VPC(Accepter)*
    - scroll down and click ***Create Peering Connection***
    - both the *Requester* and Accepter VPCs are on the same AWS account, as such click on *Actions* then *Accept Request*

## STAGE 2B - Configure Routing in each VPC to send traffic to each other
1. Configure Routes on the On-premises side VPC route by editing the route table
    - click on ***Route tables*** on the left menu of the VPC console
    - select the `onpremPublicRT`, click on the `Routes` tab and then click on `Edit routes` 
    - click on `Add route`, copy and paste the *IPv4 CIDR* of the `awsVPC`
    - as Target, click on the dropdown and select ***Peering Connection to automatically select the peering connection created earlier.
    - click on `Save changes`

2. Configure Route on the AWS Side VPC by editing the route table
    there are 2 route tables on the AWS Side, (Private and Public)
    - select the `awspublicRT` and repeat the above steps to add a route using the `onpremVPC` `IPv4 CIDR` 
    - repeat the process for the `awsPrivateRT` using the `onpremVPC` `IPv4 CIDR`
At the stage we have configured gateway object and route table in both VPCs so both environment can communicate

## STAGE 3A- Create the RDS Instance
- Navigate to AWS RDS console
- Create subnet group
    - click on ***Subnet groups*** on the left menu and click on ***Create DB Subnet group*** this is where RDS will launch the instances
    - enter `A4LDBSNGROUP` as **name** and **description
    - choose `awsVPC` from the dropdown and select `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b` under **availability zones.
    - on the VPC console - subnets, there is a public and private subnets created earlier named `aws-privateA` and `aws-privateB` with `10.16.32.0/20` and `10.16.96.0/20` as IPv4 CIDR respectively
    - under **subnets** select the two subnets above (remember that our database is not accessible to the public therefore the instances should be launched in private subnet.)
    - scroll down and click on `Create`
- Creating the Database
    - Click on `Databases` - `Create database`
    - select `standard create` `MariaDB` as **Engine option** and `free tier` **Template**
    - goto the ***parameters** of the **CloudFormation** - **Stacks** console. there you will copy the parameter values to populate the DB Setting.
    - enter `a4lwordpress` as **DB instance identifier** & **Master username**
    - enter the DBPassword parameter value which is `cats-dogs-rabbits-chickens` as **Master password** and confirm
    - under **Connectivity**, ensure the option `Donâ€™t connect to an EC2 compute resource` is selected.
    click on `Virtual private cloud (VPC)` dropdown and select `awsVPC`
    - ensure the subnet group ` a4ldbsngroup` we created is selected and choose `No` for **public access**
    - select `Choose existing` for **VPC security group (firewall)** and select `DMS-awsSecurityGroupDB-*`
    - don't forget to remove the defaul security group
    - scroll down and expand **Additional Configuration**
    - use `a4lwordpress` for ***Initial database name***
    - scroll down and click `Create database`

## STAGE 3B - Create the EC2 Instance
- Navigate to the EC2 console 
    - Click on **Instances** - **Launch instance** 
    - name should be `awsCatWeb` and select **Amazon Linux** and the free tier **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**
    - set architecture to `64-bit(x86)`
    - choose the free tier eligible instance type
    - choose a keypair or create new keypair
    - click to edit **Network settings and select `awsVPC` as **VPC**
    - select `aws-publicA` for **Subnet** 
    - select **Select existing security group** and select `DMS-awsSecurityGroupWeb-*` 
    - scroll down and expand `Advanced details` 
    - under **IAM Instance profile**, select `DMS-awsInstanceProfile-*`
    - Click `Launch Instance` and then go to *view all instances*
- Install wordpress requirements
    - select the awsCatWeb instance, click on *connect* 
    - on the **SSH client** tab copy the ssh command `ssh -i "your_keypair_name.pem" ec2-user@ec2-52-87-209-171.compute-1.amazonaws.com` 
    - open you terminal in my case, a linux terminal and run the command
    - alternatively, you can connect using the `Session Manager` tab - `connect`
    - when you are connected to your linux machine run `sudo bash` for root permission.
    - run `yum -y update` to update the machine
    - run `yum -y install httpd mariadb` to install apache web server and mysql tools.
    - run `amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2` to install php (a prerequisite for wordpress) and make sure apache is running and set to automatically startup should the instance restart.
    ```
    systemctl enable httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    ```
With this, we have a running apache web server ready to connect to our wordpress database.

## STAGE 3D - Migrate wordpress content over
- first we need to edit the SSH config on this machine to allow password authentication temporarily so we can copy the wordpress data across to the `awsCatWeb` machine from the on-premises `CatWeb` Machine
- run `nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` to open the file with nano
- scroll dow using you device arrow key to the line `PasswordAuthentication no` and change to `PasswordAuthentication yes`
- press `ctrl+o` the `enter` to save and `cltr+x` to exit the editor
- set a password on the `ec2-user` system user by running `passwd ec2-user`
- enter the same **DBPassword**, in production this should be different
- run `service sshd restart` or `systemctl restart sshd` to impliment those changes
- Navigate to the EC2 console and select the `awsCatWeb` instance and note the *private IPv4 address.
- then select the onpremises `CatWeb` instance right-click *connect* connect to the instance
- run `sudo bash`
- change directory `cd /var/www/`. You can run `ls` to see the files in the machine.
- run a secure copy to copy the html folder `scp -rp html ec2-user@private_IP_of_awsCatWeb:/home/ec2-user` and answer `yes`
- copy and enter the `DBPassword` on the parameter tab of the cloudFormation stack
- this will copy the wordpress local files (html folder) from `CatWeb` (on-premises) to `awsCatWeb` (aws)
- back to the `awsCatWeb` server
- do `cd /home/ec2-user`(same dir you are when you sshd) this is where we copied the html folder from onpremises to
- do `ls -la` to view the file
- do `cd html`
- run `cp * -R /var/www/html/` to copy all the content recursive to the webroot of `awsCatWeb`
- Fix Up Permissions and verify **awsCatWeb** works
    - run the following commands to enforce the correct permissions on the files you have just copied 
    ```
    usermod -a -G apache ec2-user   
    chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
    chmod 2775 /var/www
    find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
    find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```
- go back to the ec2 console, copy the `public IPv4 DNS` and open in a new tab.
- If it is working, it means we have successfully migrated the web application from on-premise to aws instance which is still loading and pointing to the on-premises database. In the next stage, we will migrate the database
